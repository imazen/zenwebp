# Changelog

All notable changes to zenwebp are documented here. (Started 2026-06-10;
earlier history lives in git log and LOG.md.)

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `sweep` module (`__expert`): variant-generation playbook adoption
  (patterns 1, 4, 5, 7) — mode-discriminated `SweepVariant`
  (lossy VP8 / lossless VP8L share no knob space structurally), labelled
  internal-params probe registry (def/parity/mpass/smooth/plim50),
  budgeted main-effects-first planner with fingerprint dedup and the
  one-value-at-a-time ladder, and the self-describing cell-id grammar +
  `variant_from_cell_id` parser with grammar-totality roundtrip test.
  Curated-axes exclusions documented in module docs (closed-loop
  targets, preset macro-knob, alpha/exact class-conditional,
  near_lossless metric-class — the lossless space stays 100% trial-class).
- `examples/sweep_validate.rs` (patterns 6/14/15): first run ALL HARD
  CHECKS PASSED across 41 dev≤1 cells × 7 images — every curated step
  live, every cell decode-verified, every lossless cell exact-roundtrip,
  partial-macroblock 509×381 corpus leg. Results committed at
  `benchmarks/sweep_validate_webp_2026-06-11.tsv`; adoption doc at
  `docs/VARIANT_GENERATION.md`.

### Added
- zencodec `OrientationHint` is now honored by the decode adapter. `Preserve`
  (default, unchanged) returns stored-orientation pixels + reports the stored
  (coded) dims and intrinsic EXIF `Orientation` tag; `Correct` /
  `CorrectAndTransform` / `ExactTransform` bake the resolved orientation into the
  decoded pixels (via `zenpixels-convert` `apply_orientation`) and report the
  display dims + `Orientation::Identity`. `probe`/`output_info` report
  consistently with `decode`. Native (non-zencodec) API unchanged; adapter-only,
  mirroring the heic fix. Requires `zenpixels-convert` 0.2.13 (unreleased).
  Tests: `tests/orientation.rs` (d7c54ec4).
- `cms` feature: ICC synthesis for the zencodec color-emit path via
  `zenpixels-convert/icc-db` (a bundled LZ4 profile blob + pure-Rust lz4_flex
  decoder — **no moxcms**), weak passthrough — takes effect with `zencodec`,
  covering the full ITU-T H.273 grid incl PQ/HLG. Failing to synthesize a
  needed (off-grid) ICC is an encode **error**
  (`EncodeError::IccSynthesisUnavailable`), not a silent skip: WebP has no
  CICP carrier, so an embedded ICC is the only way the color survives.
  Requires `zenpixels-convert` 0.2.13 (unreleased — adds the `icc-db`
  feature). CI tests `--features zencodec,cms`; tests
  `cicp_pq_without_cms_is_an_encode_error` / `cicp_pq_with_cms_synthesizes_icc`.
- zencodec 0.1.21 color-emit integration: the encode path reconciles ICC vs
  CICP via `resolve_color_emit` under the caller's `ColorEmitPolicy`. WebP has
  no CICP carrier, so a CICP-only source synthesizes an embedded ICC (via
  zenpixels-convert `synthesize_icc_for_cicp`, transfer-aware) instead of
  silently emitting an untagged sRGB-assumed file. Metadata retention now
  flows through `with_metadata_policy` / `Metadata::filtered`. Deps bumped to
  published zencodec 0.1.21 / zenpixels 0.2.11 / zenpixels-convert 0.2.12
  (8bc51dbe).

### Known issues
- dev-dependency `webpx = "0.1.4"` is yanked on crates.io. Builds resolve via
  the committed `Cargo.lock`; a fresh `cargo update` fails until the webpx dep
  is migrated to a current release (0.3.4 at time of writing).
